# ANZ_Virtual_Internship
Data Science is a contact sport at ANZ, the virtual internship program include EDA and predictive analysis with real world data.
### Prerequisites
[jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

[Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

[matplotlib 3.3](https://matplotlib.org/)

[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Basic Stastistical Concept

### Goal of Task

This task is totally based on python 3.9 which is used as a stastical software for data analytics,visualization and predictive modiling. In this task we extract several information from dataset like annual income and correlation between others atributes of coustomer. And visualizing the correlation. Once i get the points of correlation between several atributes ,bulid a machinelearning model which is predict the anual income of a coustomer. And check the accuracy of the model over the test dataset.This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.
The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data.
